## Purpose
The purpose of the book is to guide the reader's preparation  to crack the coding interviews. Preparing for the coding interview, not easy! Cracking the coding interivew? Like impossible for most of us! Luck does play a slight role sometimes in the outcome. So, just treating it as a learning process.  No matter what the result is, there will be no regret. 

Computer Science is really not just computer science. It is a combination of all fields; our normal interview problems fall into the eumerative combinatorics and our computer vision mostly is related to Linear Algebra. What really matters is our passion about learning more and applying it to solve real-life problems. How about forgetting about cracking the coding interviews, and just simply enjoy a ride that trying to seek the `soul` of the programming world. I'm just like you, I love to learn and I love to write and try to do a better job.  No  matter how much time it takes, because I love learning it! 

There are plenty of books out there focusing on either teaching algorithmic knowledge  (*Introduction to Algorithms*, *Algorithmic Problem Solving*, etc) or introducing interview process and solving interview problems(*Cracking the Coding Interview*--seriously, you are not likely to crack any interviews with this book, haha!, *Coding Interview Questions*, etc), but barely any that combines the two. This is a book designed to make up this role in the categorization; learning the algorithmic problem solving by analyzing and practicing interview problems -- a reciprocal relationship that makes 1+1=4: Algorithms, Interviews, Passion, and Confidence.

<!---We guide the reader to master data structures, algorithm design and analysis, and problem-patterns through playing around with toy examples coded in Python thoroughly. Analyzing the behavior and computational complexity of more restricted and clearly-defined problems in the book helps lay the foundation of solving real-world problems which are more open and challenging. -->

This is **NOT** a book that provides hiring statistic of each company or gives the reader quick tricks in order to pass a few coding interviews(T'm not good with NLP, 'cause I'm a computer vision person).  Its purpose is to show you the beauty of the algorithimc problem solving in the hope that you will be more passionate and condifent about software engineering; the interview questions just set up a play ground where we strengthen what we learn. A strong candidate would be apt to sleep well before interviews, walk into the interviews and discuss his or her findings about the question from all possible angles and program the best solution for on the white-board. The interviews shall be a setting the interviewers and interviewees both have a nice and happy talk; learning from each other instead of a one-way relation -- tester and testee. 

<!---## Progress
I'm currently in full strength finalizing and finishing the book, it will likely to be published at the beignning of 2020. This repo is not well-maintenanced, but I will keep it up when I feel the content is nice and ready. You can view the [current version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AH0Hc9sLknLt1Wz4md0wTH2s6JhFCTgz/view?usp=sharing)  through google drive sharable link.-->

## Content Format
Related content will be posted in the form of [medium publication](https://medium.com/algorithms-and-leetcode) and as a book in pdf instead of directly using markdown for better visual appearance and organization.
