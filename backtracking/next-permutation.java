/*
Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

1,2,3 â†’ 1,3,2
3,2,1 â†’ 1,2,3
1,1,5 â†’ 1,5,1

/*
Idea is to iterate from end and find the first decreasing pair. That number is to be swapped with the number on the right 
which is just greater than the number. And then at the end reverse the entire array the element. (as after swapping the right
side array is just a decreasing array).
