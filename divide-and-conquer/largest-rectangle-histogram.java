Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of 
largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Example:

Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10

// Stack based O(n) solution...

/* Idea is:
    1. For every height we need to know:
        a) its right range (i.e., how many boxes it can go to its right).
        b) its left range (i.e., how many boxes it can cover on its left).
    2. But as we need an O(n) solution, while we are at a box i, we cannot look forward or backward.
    3. Giving a thought, the right range of any box is when it encounters a box smaller than it's own height.
    4. If we iterate the array and keep adding heights as long as we see a bigger height, and on finding a height 
       smaller or EQUAL than the last height, we pop the last height, and calculate it's left and right ranges and update 
       the global max.
    5. Repeat the above process for entire array.
    6. Getting right range is simple: (current height index - the stack.peek()'s height)
    7. Getting left range: peek after a stack pop (i.e., one before).
    8. An example: Say current height index is 5 and stack.peek() is 3 and stack.peek.peek() is 1. The range for stack.peek 
        is 3 boxes, i.e., index 2, index 3 and index 4. So the formula is (5 - 3) + (3 - 1) - 1. 
        [Notice the minus 1 because 3 is counted twice].
    9. A special case when there is no stack.peek.peek if we want to use the above generic formula always. 
        (5 - 3) + (3 - 0) - 1. which gives 4 but the answer should be 5. If stack is empty, it means we need to consider 
        the elem 0 as well, hence a -1 for empty stack.
    
    Once the array iteration is complete.
    1. The element at the top of stack will always be the last element. If it was the greatest, it stays at the top or 
    if it was <=, it will remove all the previous once and stays at top. So the right index is fixed, i.e., height.length.
