/*
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

// In a complete tree, the last level is filled from the left. Before the last level all levels have full nodes.
// So we just need to know how many nodes are there in the last level.
// We can do a binary search for the last level's (0 to 2^d nodes). Sort of quickselect search.
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] In this array a node is on the left side of the tree if it belongs to the first half
// or on the right side if it belongs to the right half.
// We move left or right depending on the position of the node in the array and thus finally reach the last level.
// If that node is a null element then return false and we half our search. It's a Binary search within another binary search.
// One binary search for the last nodes of the leaf and another for moving left or right in the tree.
